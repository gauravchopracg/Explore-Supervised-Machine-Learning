# Explore-Supervised-Machine-Learning
In this task, we will try to understand supervised machine learning through regression i.e., by predicting the precentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 

Data has been borrowed from [here](http://bit.ly/w-data)

## Dependencies

* numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* pandas
* matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/1.5.1/users/installing.html)
* urllib (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib3)

Install missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the demo script in terminal via

```
jupyter notebook
```
or simply try [colab version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zhilJ8-9JcLNVi9J2kbo_mkD3tzM-A4L?usp=sharing)
